        We aim to democratise the technology
        education for all<br/><br/> 
        
        Since 2018, Karka academy is running intensive bootcamps in our learning labs to provide industry ready engineers to IT companies and make people take right career path.
        PROBLEM<br/><br>
        
        In our country, there are more and more youngsters who graduate each year. But companies are finding it really hard to identify right talents. Most of the students that graduate fall under either first generation graduates OR from not so-good socio-economic <br><br>
        
        They really do not know how to identify & target appropriate job roles. They often end-up in jobs that don't deem fit for their ability. Also, in search of fortune they move to metro/tier-1 cities like Chennai, Bangalore etc., where they have to spend a lot of money in getting trained in appropriate training programmes and end up in jobs (and ofcourse spend for their survival until they get a job).  <br><br>
        <br><br>
        SOLUTION <br><br>
        
        Hence there is a need to address this problem by providing support from industry practitioners to such graduates and make them industry ready. Such support from industry practitioners is not often available in tier-2, tier-3 cities. Especially in the Kanyakumari district that we operate. <br><br>
        
        Karka Academy acts as a high-lane bridge connecting them. <br><br>
